# Hexodus

A play on word of exodus, meaning a mass departure or more generally, a mass movement of people from one place to another. This addon brings back gravity changing for Hexcasting, although with a few balance tweaks. Gravity alterations now only last for a few seconds but using other addons or just spam-clicking an artifact, it can be infinitely refreshed. This mod also adds ballasts, items that a Hexcaster can hold and manipulate with Hex to get a sustained gravitational pull and be unmoved by other Hexes.
